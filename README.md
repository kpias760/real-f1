# real-f1

New era of haxball racing. Real F1 event includes:
â€¢ 5 different tyres compounds: ðŸ”´ - soft, ðŸŸ¡ - medium, âšª - hard, ðŸŸ¢ - intermediate, ðŸ”µ - wet. Softs are the fastest, but the least durable. Drivers will have their tyres shown on the avatar.
â€¢ tyres degradation - every lap your tyres are slower and slower
â€¢ slipstream - speed boost when you are right behind the opponent
â€¢ the weather changing during the race - intermediates and wets will handle rain much better than others
â€¢ DRS zone - speed boost activated automatically
â€¢ blue flags - slower drivers that are being lapped will be not only shown the blue flag, but they'll also receive ghost physics to ensure they'll not disturb the faster drivers
â€¢ chance of safety car and virtual safety car
â€¢ player's backup - if you leave a room during the race, you'll have a chance to get back to the place you were before leaving
